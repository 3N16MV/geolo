This is the distribution package for GeoLo Initial Release (April, 2024).

This package is Exercise 1 of Chapter 13 from the Book: Python for 
Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3 by Charles Severance. 
ISBN: 9781530051120

This exercise was conducted as an assignment for Cyebrsecurity Class
CYB333-25957 at National University. This program takes the seach 
string and constructs a URL with the search string as a properly
encoded parameter and then uses urllib to retrieve the text from 
the Google geocoding API. 

You can find a copy of the orifinal code used for the exercise at 
http:www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py.

Note: Google's geocoding service is free but rate limited so you can not
make unlimited use of the API in a commercial application. When you are
using a free API like Google's geocoding API, be respecful. If too many
people abuse the service, Google may drop its free use of the service.
